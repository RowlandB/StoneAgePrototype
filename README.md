# StoneAgePrototype
This is a personal project that emulates a board game that I am currently prototyping (so I suppose it should really be called Stone Age Prototype Prototype).

The main purpose of this is to test various configurations and versions of cards in the different decks. Thus, the most important features are:
-pulling card data from CSV files/card, deck, and game functionality
-being able to view the board and player hands
-unintelligent AI to simulate other player behavior
